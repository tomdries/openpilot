The script calibrationd.py is part of the openpilot project, which is an open-source driver assistance system. This script is responsible for finding calibration values for the device.

The script begins by importing necessary modules and setting up some global variables. It then defines several functions that are used to manage the calibration process:

is_calibration_valid(rpy: np.ndarray) -> bool: This function checks if the roll, pitch, and yaw (RPY) values are within the defined limits.

sanity_clip(rpy: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray: This function clips the RPY values to be within a slightly extended range of the defined limits.

moving_avg_with_linear_decay(prev_mean: np.ndarray, new_val: np.ndarray, idx: int, block_size: float) -> np.ndarray: This function calculates a moving average with linear decay.

class Calibrator: This class is responsible for managing the calibration process. It has several methods to handle different aspects of the calibration process, such as handling the vehicle's speed, handling the camera's odometry data, updating the calibration status, and sending calibration data.

calibrationd_thread(sm: Optional[messaging.SubMaster] = None, pm: Optional[messaging.PubMaster] = None) -> NoReturn: This function is the main loop of the calibration process. It continuously updates the SubMaster with new data, handles the vehicle's speed and the camera's odometry data, and sends calibration data.

main(sm: Optional[messaging.SubMaster] = None, pm: Optional[messaging.PubMaster] = None) -> NoReturn: This function is the entry point of the script. It calls the calibrationd_thread() function to start the calibration process.

The script ends with a block of code that is executed when the script is run as a standalone program. This block of code calls the main() function to start the calibration process.
