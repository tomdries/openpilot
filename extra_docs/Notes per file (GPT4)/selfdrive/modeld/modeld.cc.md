Based on the documentation provided, we can see that the inputs and outputs to the model align with the previous assumptions, with additional details on the specific implementation.

Inputs to the model:

1. `frame` and `wide_frame`: These are two consecutive images, each represented in YUV420 format with 6 channels. The images have dimensions of 256x512 (height x width), and are recorded at 20Hz. The first four channels represent the full-res Y channel, divided into four parts. The last two channels represent the half-res U and V channels respectively. This interpretation was correct in the initial assumption.

2. `output`: This is a buffer of intermediate features that gets appended to the current feature to form a 5 seconds temporal context (at 20FPS). It's an array of size `NET_OUTPUT_SIZE`, which is the sum of `OUTPUT_SIZE` and `TEMPORAL_SIZE` as defined in the code.

3. `prev_desire` and `pulse_desire`: These are one-hot encoded buffers to command the model to execute certain actions. The bit needs to be sent for the past 5 seconds (at 20FPS), represented as an array of size `DESIRE_LEN`.

4. `traffic_convention`: This is a one-hot encoded vector to tell the model whether traffic is right-hand or left-hand traffic. It's an array of size `TRAFFIC_CONVENTION_LEN`.

Outputs from the model:

1. `plans`: An array of `PLAN_MHP_N` `ModelOutputPlanPrediction` objects, each containing trajectory predictions.

2. `lane_lines`: An object containing information about the predicted positions and probabilities of various lane lines.

3. `road_edges`: An object containing information about the predicted positions of the edges of the road.

4. `leads`: An array of `LEAD_MHP_N` `ModelOutputLeadPrediction` objects, each containing predictions about leading vehicles.

5. `stop_lines`: An array of `STOP_LINE_MHP_N` `ModelOutputStopLinePrediction` objects, each containing predictions about stop lines.

6. `meta`: An object containing various meta-information, including probabilities of various desires, engagement, disengagement, and blinker states.

7. `pose`: An object containing information about the vehicle's predicted velocity and rotation.

The model uses these outputs to guide the actions of a self-driving vehicle by predicting the positions and movements of other vehicles, lane lines, and road edges, as well as the desires of the vehicle itself. The specifics of the output format can be found in the linked documentation.

# Q and A: 

### QUESTION:
- What does the one-hot encoded desire vector consist of? Explain all vector indices.
- What is the output of the model? How is it logged, or how could I record it?
- How is the output stored? Explain the coordinate system and the matrix layout.

### ANSWER:
The one-hot encoded desire vector consists of a buffer to command the model to execute certain actions. The bit needs to be sent for the past 5 seconds (at 20FPS), resulting in a vector of size 100 * 8. The indices of this vector are not explicitly explained in the provided documentation, but in a typical one-hot encoding, each index corresponds to a unique category or class. In this context, each index could correspond to a unique driving action or command.

The output of the model, according to the documentation, is a ModelOutput object that includes the desired driving path and other metadata such as lane lines, lead cars, road edges, and more. This output is logged or recorded through the model_publish and posenet_publish functions. If you want to record it differently, you could modify these functions or create a new function to handle the output data as per your requirements.

The way output is stored is not explicitly specified in the provided documentation. However, given the context, it can be inferred that the output is stored in the ModelOutput object. The coordinate system and matrix layout for this output would be specific to the data included in the ModelOutput, such as the driving path, lane lines, lead cars, etc. This is a speculative answer as the exact details are not given in the provided context.

Please note that these answers are based on the provided context and might not be completely accurate without further specific details or the actual source code.

### QUESTION: about recurrent state

The recurrent state is a vector that is fed back into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for temporal context. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and their variant GRUs, are types of neural networks that have an internal state used to process sequences of inputs. This allows them to effectively consider historical context when making predictions.

In the context of the Supercombo model, the recurrent state vector of size 512 is part of the input and output format. This suggests that the model uses this state from the previous prediction as part of the input for the next prediction. This allows the model to maintain some form of 'memory' or temporal context about the previous states of the system, which can be crucial in time-dependent tasks such as driving.

For instance, the current desired driving action could be heavily influenced by the previous actions (e.g., if the car has been turning left, it will likely continue to do so in the immediate future). This temporal context can help make the model's predictions more accurate and consistent over time.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variant, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), are types of neural networks that are designed to work with sequential data. They do this by maintaining an internal state that they use to remember some of the information they have seen in previous time steps. This internal state serves as a form of memory.

In the context of the Supercombo model, this internal state is represented by the recurrent state vector. This vector is part of both the input and output of the model.

As input, the recurrent state vector represents the internal state from the previous time step. This provides the model with some context about what it has seen in the past. For example, if the model is trying to predict the path of a car, the recurrent state vector could contain information about the car's previous positions and velocities. This can help the model make a more accurate prediction about where the car will go next.

As output, the recurrent state vector represents the new internal state after the current time step. This state will then be fed back into the model as input in the next time step.

So in essence, the recurrent state vector allows the Supercombo model to maintain a kind of ongoing memory of past events, which it can then use to inform future predictions. This is particularly useful in tasks like driving, where the current state of the system is often heavily dependent on its past states. For instance, if a car has been turning left for the past few seconds, it's likely that it will continue to do so in the immediate future. The recurrent state vector allows the model to capture these kinds of temporal dependencies.

# Code Documentation

This code is part of the openpilot project, an open-source, semi-automated driving system developed by comma.ai. It consists of several components related to vehicle control, sensor data processing, and machine learning models for driving behavior prediction.

This specific code file focuses on the integration of various machine learning models used in the openpilot system, including the driving model and the navigation model. It's written in C++ and makes extensive use of the Eigen library for linear algebra operations, and the OpenCL library for GPU computations.

## Main Components

### 1. Calibration Update Function

The `update_calibration` function is responsible for updating the calibration matrix which is used to transform the camera view to the model view. It takes in the current calibration euler angles, and flags indicating whether the wide camera is used and whether the big model frame is selected.

### 2. The Model Run Function

The `run_model` function is the main loop that continuously receives camera frames, updates calibration, tracks dropped frames, updates the navigation model, and evaluates the driving model. It then publishes the model outputs to the messaging system.

Key components of the `run_model` function include:

- **Messaging**: It uses the `PubMaster` and `SubMaster` classes from the messaging library to communicate with other components of the system.
- **Parameters**: It uses the `Params` class to read system parameters.
- **Frame Drop Tracking**: It uses a first order filter to track dropped frames and adjusts the model execution accordingly.
- **Model Evaluation**: It uses the `model_eval_frame` function to evaluate the driving model and publish the results.

### 3. Main Function

The `main` function initializes the OpenCL context, loads the models, connects to the vision IPC clients, and then starts the main model run loop. It also handles system exit signals and cleans up resources on exit.

## Models

The code integrates several machine learning models:

- **Driving Model**: This model is responsible for predicting the driving actions based on the current camera view and other sensor data.
- **Navigation Model**: This model predicts the navigation features based on the current camera view and other sensor data.

The models are loaded and initialized using the `model_init` function, and evaluated using the `model_eval_frame` function.

## Vision IPC Clients

The code uses the `VisionIpcClient` class to receive camera frames from the visiond process. It supports receiving frames from two camera streams, the main stream and the extra wide stream. These streams are used to provide different views of the road to the models.

## Messaging

The code uses the messaging library to communicate with other components of the openpilot system. It publishes the model outputs to the `modelV2` and `cameraOdometry` channels, and subscribes to the `lateralPlan`, `roadCameraState`, `liveCalibration`, `driverMonitoringState`, and `navModel` channels to receive necessary inputs.

## Hardware and OS Utilities

The code uses several utility functions to interact with the hardware and the operating system, such as setting the real-time priority, setting the core affinity, and getting the current time.

## Model Output Publishing

After evaluating the driving model, the code publishes the model outputs to the messaging system using the `model_publish` and `posenet_publish` functions.

## Calibration

The code updates the calibration matrix based on the current calibration euler angles and the selected camera view and model frame. The calibration matrix is used to transform the camera view to the model view.
